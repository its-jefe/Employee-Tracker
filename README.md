# Employee Tracker

## Description 

This node.js application uses MySQL2 and Inquirer to store, retrieve, and edit company data (employees, roles, departments) in an SQL database. 

## Usage

At this point I have not made it around to elaborating on ID's
i.e. Department, role, and manager IDs all show as only the number... They work fine, but I will JOIN tables abd show more readable titles

Thanks for viewing!
